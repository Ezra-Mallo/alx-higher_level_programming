Object Oriented Programming
Object-Oriented Programming:
	“First-class Everything,” 
	“A Minimal Class in Python,” 
	“Attributes,” “Methods,” 
	“The __init__ Method,” 
	“Data Abstraction, 
	Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding,” 
	“__str__- and __repr__-Methods,”

Class and Instance Attributes

In this project, I learned how to write unitest and doctest for my codes.

## Helper File :raised_hands:
| File                   | Prototype                                                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `00-rectangle.py,`     | `class Rectangle:`                                         |

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0.** Integers addition   mandatory
   * Write a function that adds 2 integers.
   * [Prototype:] def add_integer(a, b=98):
   * a and b must be integers or floats, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message a must be an integer or b must be an integer
   * a and b must be first casted to integers if they are float
   * Returns an integer: the addition of a and b
   * You are not allowed to import any module
